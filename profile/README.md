# A Cuis-Smalltalk question? Ask Dr. Cuis!

Welcome to the **C**uis **D**ocumentation **P**roject

## What you will find here
In an unique place, easy to identify (http://doc.cuis.st), are
documentations, in various formats, for the free
[Cuis-Smalltalk](http://cuis.st) system. The documentation is structured in four categories:

* **Tutorials.** This is the documentation you want to read when first
  learning Cuis or when you want to learn a very specific facet of
  Cuis.
* **How-to guides.** These guides are step by step procedures to
  resolve specific problems.
* **References.** In this category we provide technical documentation
  on various facets of Cuis.
* **Explanations.** To have a broader picture of Cuis, how it is
  positioned regarding the Smalltalk-80 system reference, take a look
  there.

### Tutorials

* [Quick Tour](https://github.com/DrCuis/Learning-Cuis/blob/master/Quick-UI-Tour.md)
  A quick warm-up to learn a bit the Cuis-Smalltalk system
  environment.
* [The Cuis Book](https://drcuis.github.io/TheCuisBook), good first
  reading when discovering Cuis and learning programming, particularly
  the chapters 1 to 5.

### How-to guides

* **Drag and Drop.**
   * [Understanding Drag and Drop Mechanics](https://github.com/DrCuis/Technical/blob/main/Morphic/DragAndDrop.md)

* **Packaging.**
   * [How-to make a simple package](https://github.com/DrCuis/Learning-Cuis/blob/master/SamplePackage1.md)
   * [The package](https://drcuis.github.io/TheCuisBook/The-Package.html) chapter from the *The Cuis Book*

* **Layout in GUI.**

## Why Dr. Cuis?
Any good software deserves good documentation. It is useful to foster
the understanding and know-how of any new system, _Yes Smalltalk is
still new!_ Good documentation is useful to both individual for
self-learning experience and school institutions as high schools,
colleges, universities; good documentation drastically improve the
acceptance of any new system and soften the burden of producing vast
amount of teaching materials.

## Community 
The Cuis-Smalltalk project is built, maintained and improved by an
enthusiastic community of humans around the world. Whether you are a
veteran Smalltalk user or a fresh Cuis enthusiast, you should consider
how you can give back to the Cuis project. Participating to the Cuis
Documentation Project is a very smart and fun way to do it: you can
both give back and improve your own skill in programming, Cuis and
writing documentation. Writing documentation is a journey where the
writer is as transformed as is the reader. **Because we think
documentation is as important as code, we want the authors of the
written documentation to be clearly identified and acknowledged,
particularly in the how-to guides too often anonymous.**

Participation can be in one of the existing repository below or by
starting a complete new one, for example starting a new booklet in a
topic you want to explore or using a particular tool that fit your
taste when writing documentation. It is likely other people in the
community will be interested too.
