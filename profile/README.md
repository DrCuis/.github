# A Cuis-Smalltalk question? Ask Dr. Cuis!

Welcome to the **C**uis **D**ocumentation **P**roject

## What you will find here
In a unique place, easy to identify (http://doc.cuis.st), is
documentation, in various formats, for the free
[Cuis-Smalltalk](http://cuis.st) system. The documentation is
structured in four categories as described in the [documentation
system](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system):

* **[Tutorials.](http://github.com/DrCuis/Tutorials)** This is the
  documentation you want to read when first learning Cuis or when you
  want to learn a very specific facet of Cuis.
* **[How-to Guides.](http://github.com/DrCuis/How-to-guides)** These
  guides are step-by-step procedures to resolve specific problems.
* **[References.](http://github.com/DrCuis/References-guides)** In this
  category, we provide technical documentation on various facets of
  Cuis.
* **[Explanations.](http://github.com/DrCuis/Explanations)** To have a
  broader picture of Cuis and how it is positioned regarding the
  Smalltalk-80 system reference, take a look here.

## Why Dr. Cuis?
Any good software deserves good documentation. It is helpful to foster
an understanding and know-how of any new system - _Yes, Smalltalk is
still new!_ Good documentation is helpful to both individuals for
a self-learning experience and for school institutions such as high schools,
colleges, and universities; good documentation drastically improves the
acceptance of any new system and softens the burden of producing vast
amounts of teaching materials.

## Community 
The Cuis-Smalltalk project is built, maintained, and improved by an
enthusiastic community of humans around the world. Whether you are a
veteran Smalltalk user or a fresh Cuis enthusiast, you should consider
how you can give back to the Cuis project. Participating in the Cuis
Documentation Project is a very smart and fun way to do it: you can
both give back and improve your own skills in programming and
writing documentation. Writing documentation is a journey where the
writer is as transformed as the reader. **Because we think
documentation is as important as code, we want the authors of the
written documentation to be clearly identified and acknowledged,
particularly in the how-to guides, where they too often remain anonymous.**

Participation can be in one of the existing repositories below, or
start a completely new one, for example, starting a new booklet in a
topic you want to explore, or using a particular tool that fits your
taste when writing documentation. It is likely that other people in the
community will be interested too.
