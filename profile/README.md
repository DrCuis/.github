  learning Cuis, or when you want to learn a very specific facet of
  Cuis.
* **How-to Guides** These guides are step-by-step procedures to
  resolve specific problems.
* **References** In this category, we provide technical documentation
  on various facets of Cuis.
* **Explanations** To have a broader picture of Cuis and how it is
  positioned regarding the Smalltalk-80 system reference, take a look
  here.

## Why Dr. Cuis?
Any good software deserves good documentation. It is helpful to foster
an understanding and know-how of any new system - _Yes, Smalltalk is
still new!_ Good documentation is helpful to both individuals for
a self-learning experience and for school institutions such as high schools,
colleges, and universities; good documentation drastically improves the
acceptance of any new system and softens the burden of producing vast
amounts of teaching materials.

## Community 
The Cuis-Smalltalk project is built, maintained, and improved by an
enthusiastic community of humans around the world. Whether you are a
veteran Smalltalk user or a fresh Cuis enthusiast, you should consider
how you can give back to the Cuis project. Participating in the Cuis
Documentation Project is a very smart and fun way to do it: you can
both give back and improve your own skills in programming and
writing documentation. Writing documentation is a journey where the
writer is as transformed as the reader. **Because we think
documentation is as important as code, we want the authors of the
written documentation to be clearly identified and acknowledged,
particularly in the how-to guides, where they too often remain anonymous.**

Participation can be in one of the existing repositories below, or
start a completely new one, for example, starting a new booklet in a
topic you want to explore, or using a particular tool that fits your
taste when writing documentation. It is likely that other people in the
community will be interested too.
